# angular-disclosure-panel

This is a bunch of directives for writing disclosure panels.

# Why do this?
There didn't seem to be a particularly good solution to opening and closing sections of data.  At least, not one I could find.  The principle of these directives is not to provide a "complete" solution, but to provide a toolset for allowing designers/web developers to specify a button and specify some content that is included or hidden depending on how that button is pressed.
