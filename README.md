# angular-disclosure-panel

This is a bunch of directives for writing disclosure panels.

# Why do this?
There didn't seem to be a particularly good solution to opening and closing sections of data.  At least, not one I could fine.  Sure, you could use accordions, but these often have some serious limitations.  For example, some accordion panels don't include a class on the container to indicate whether the content was displayed or not or provide a mechanism to display content when a trigger button is 'closed'.
